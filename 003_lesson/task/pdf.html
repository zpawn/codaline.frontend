        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            This short note provides a guide to using the ENTCS macro package for
            preparing papers for publication in your conference <i>Proceedings</i>. The <i>Pro-
            ceedings</i> may be printed and hard copies distributed to participants at the
            meeting; this is an option to Conference Organizers may choose to exercise.
            The <i>Proceedings</i> also will be par of a volume in the series <i>Electronic Notes
            in Theoretical Computer Science</i> (ENTCS), which is published under the aus-
            pices of Elsevier Science B. V., the publishers of <i>Theoretical Computer Science</i>.
            It’s home page is <span class="text-mono">http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs</span>
        </p>
        <p>The ENTCS macro package consists of two files:</p>
        <p>entcs.cls, the basic style file, and</p>

        <p>
            <span class="text-mono">entcsmacro.sty</span>, a macro file containing the definitions of some of the
            theorem-like environments and a few other tidbits.
        </p>
        <p>
            The formatting these style files impose should <i>not</i> be altered – the reason for
            using them is to attain a uniform format for all papers in the <i>Proceedings</i> of
            which your paper is a part.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additional macro files can be added using <span class="text-mono">\usepackage{...}</span>. The file
            <span class="text-mono">entcsmacro.sty</span> <i>must</i> be included in the list, as is done at the start of the
            source file for this paper.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ENTCS package requires a relatively up-to-date <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span> system in order
            to be successfully used. This is reflected in two other packages that are called
            by entcs.cls, which must be available on your machine. These are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The hyperref package. This package allows the use of hyperlinks in files prepared
                using <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span>2e, one of the main
                features of Adobe’s Acrobat<sup>&copy;</sup> Reader software. Be sure that you have at least version
                6.69d of this pack-age.
            </li>
            <li>
                The ifpdf package. This is used by hyperref to differentiate between the
                use of pdf<span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span> and
                <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span>2e, followed by dvips and then ps2pdf.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The file <span class="text-mono">instraut.dvi</span> contains information about the use of
            <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span>to pre- pare files for online publication by
            Elsevier. This file refers to the older version of <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span>
            that is no longer suppported, and that is inadequate for preparing <span class="text-mono">.pdf</span> files
            for online publication. Reading this file should answer most of the basic questions about
            <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span> that might arise.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Frontmatter</h3>
        <p>
            The biggest difference between a “usual” <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span> style
            such as <span class="text-mono">article.sty</span> and the ENTCS package is that the ENTCS macro package
            requires the title, author’s name or names, abstract, keywords and “thanks” all to be included
            within the <span class="text-mono">frontmatter</span> environment. At the beginning of the source file for
            this paper, you’ll notice this. Also, you’ll notice that the usual <span class="text-mono">\maketitle</span>
            is absent; it no longer is needed. The ENTCS style package automatically generates the title, author’s
            name and address, and related material at the beginning of the paper. Note also that hyperref has been
            disabled in this part of the entcs.cls file, so references to footnotes aren’t linked to the appropriate
            footenotes or addresses. This is an old problem with <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span>,
            involving the fact that the references within the frontmatter aren’t passed cleanly to the linking software.
        </p>
        <p>
            For those who have used the ENTCS package before, the one new thing
            to note is the inclusion of <i>Keywords</i>; these are now required by Elsevier –
            they’re also required by ACM’s <i>Computing Reviews</i> which reviews ENTCS publications.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ENTCS macro package provides two alternatives to listing authors names and addresses. These are described
            in detail in the file <span class="text-mono">instraut.dvi</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Basically, listing each author and his or her address in turn, is the simplest
            method. But, if there are several authors and two or more share the same
            address (but not all authors are at this address), then the method of listing
            authors first, and then the addresses, and of referencing addresses to authors
            should be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, notice that acknowledgment of support (the contents of <span class="text-mono">\thanks</span>)
            should be done by a separate listing of <span class="text-mono">\thanks[NSF]{To the NSF}</span> with the
            optional argument – <span class="text-mono">[NSF]</span> – being used for <span class="text-mono">\thanksref</span>
            which is attached to those authors acknowledging such support. It is important that the <span class="text-mono">\thanks</span>
            not be included within the scope of <span class="text-mono">\author{}</span> or of
            <span class="text-mono">\title{}</span>, but it must be within the scope of the environment <span class="text-mono">frontmatter</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            More details about added terms such as <span class="text-mono">\collab</span> can be found in inst.dvi,
            if they are needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, notice that the command <span class="text-mono">\lastname{My Lastname}</span> has been in-
            cluded <i>before</i> the <span class="text-mono">frontmatter</span> begins. This command should contain the
            last names of the authors of the paper. If there are no more than three au-
            thors, then they should be listed with the word “and” between the last two;
            if more than three authors collaborated on the paper, then the first author
            only should be listed, together with <span class="text-mono">\emph{et al}</span>. This command creates
            the headline for each page after page 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, please be sure to include an abstract for your paper.
        </p>

        <h3>Sectioning and Environments</h3>
        <p>
            Since ENTCS is published through the auspices of Elsevier Science B. V., their
            style files have been used to create the ENTCS macro package. Here’s a proof
            that this package is not much different than most of the ones one encounters:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Definition 3.1</strong> A file is <i>derived</i> from another if it is obtained with only a few
            modifications from the original file.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Theorem 3.2</strong> <i>The file</i> <span class="text-mono">entcs.cls</span> <i>is derived</i> 
            <span class="text-mono">from elsart.sty</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Proof.</strong> This is clear from the similarity of the output to the output from
            Elsevier’s style files.
        </p>
        <p>
            If one wants to start a proof with a descriptive word, such as “sketch”,
            then one can use the <span class="text-mono">\begin{proof*}...\end{proof*}</span> environment, as in
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Proof (Sketch)</strong> This can be derived from simple observations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main differences between the file <span class="text-mono">entcs.cls</span> and the <span class="text-mono">elsartr.cls</span> file
            used by Elsevier are the more precise format we use – Elsevier’s generic files are
            meant for preliminary editing, and more precise formatting is imposed using a macro file designed for the specific Elsevier journal in which the paper will
            eventually appear. The <span class="text-mono">entcs.cls</span> and <span class="text-mono">entcsmacro.sty</span> files format papers
            3Please list Your Lastname Here uniformly so that they all are easily recognizable as being from the series
            <i>Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the usual features of <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span> are available with these style files –
            it is only the formatting that has been rigorously defined. Thus, one has
            available the sectioning commands <span class="text-mono">\section</span>, <span class="text-mono">\subsection</span>,
            <span class="text-mono">\paragraph</span> and <span class="text-mono">\subparagraph</span>. The numbering scheme used is one under which Theorem
            1.2.3 is the third numbered item in second subsection of the first section of the paper. In order to facilitate 
            cross-references, all of the named environments given below are numbered, and all use the same number scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
            The file entcsmacro.sty contains additional information that is needed to
            typeset a paper. It also has the definitions of the AMS euler and blackboard
            bold fonts builtin. If you want to use symbols for the natural numbers, the
            reals, etc., then we prefer that you use the blackboard bold fonts, and not
            plain bold fonts. This is accomplished by using the <span class="text-mono">\mathbb</span> font, as in N or
            R.
        </p>
        <p>
            The names of theorem-like environments are provided in <span class="text-mono">entcsmacro.sty</span>.
            With the exception of the environment Algorithm, the names of all of these
            are full name, rather than a shortened version. The environments provided
            and their names are

        <h3>References and Cross-references</h3>
        <p>
            All the cross-referencing facilities of <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span> are supported, so one can use
            <span class="text-mono">\ref{}</span> and <span class="text-mono">\cite{}</span> for cross-references within the paper and for references
            to bibliographic items. As is done in this note, the <strong>References</strong> section <a href="#link6">6</a> can
            be composed with <span class="text-mono">\begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}</span>.
            Alternatively, BibTEX can be used to compile the bibliography. Whichever
            one is used, the references are to be numbered consecutively, rather than by
            author-defined acronyms. Of course you can use your own acronyms for easy
            reference to each of the items in the bibliography, as has been done with the
            listing for this short note.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, note that the references should <i>not</i> be started with a new <span class="text-mono">\section</span>
            command.
        </p>
        <p>
            The package hyperref is automatically loaded by entcs.cls, and this makes
            all the cross-references within the document “active” when the pdf file of the
            paper is viewed with Adobe’s Acrobat<sup>&copy;</sup> Reader. The format for including
            a link is simple: simply insert <span class="text-mono">\href{URL} {text}</span> where <i>URL</i> is the URL
            to which you want the link to point, and <i>text</i> is the text you want to be
            highlighted, which when clicked upon will bring up the desired web page.
        </p>

        <i>4.1 Particulars about</i> <span class="text-mono">.pdf</span> files
        <p>
            We now require that <span class="text-mono">.pdf</span> files be provided for publication online. A <span class="text-mono">.pdf</span>
            file is viewable by Adobe’s Acrobat<sup>&copy;</sup> viewer, which can be configured to load
            automatically within a browser. Viewing a properly formatted .pdf file with
            Acrobat c allows the cross-references and links to URLs to be active. In fact,
            Elsevier utilizes .pdf files in order to take better advantage of the web’s ca-
            pabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            But one point we want to emphasize is that you should be sure to use Type
            1 fonts when you typeset your <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span> source file. These fonts are scalable,
            meaning that they carry information that allows the devise viewing the final
            output to scale the fonts to suit the viewer being used – from an onscreen
            viewer such as Adobe’s Acrobat c Reader, to printing the file on a printer.
            You can tell if you have used the right fonts by viewing the final output on
            your machine. It the fonts look grainy, then you have not used Type 1 fonts.
            They can be located at the CTAN archive <a href="http://www.ctan.org" class="text-mono">http://www.ctan.org</a> – they are
            public domain fonts, and don’t cost anything to add them to your system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Assuming you have Type 1 fonts available, then there are there methods
            for producing <span class="text-mono">.pdf</span> files.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Using</strong> <span class="text-mono">dvips</span> <strong>and</strong> <span class="text-mono">ps2pdf</span></p>
        <p>
            We list this option first since it appears to be the most reliable and the
            easiest to use, especially if you include embedded PostScript graphics (<span class="text-mono">.eps</span>
            files) in your source file. Simply run <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span>2e on your source file, then apply
            dvips to produce a PostScript file, and finally apply ps2pdf to obtain a <span class="text-mono">.pdf</span>
            file.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The</strong> <span class="text-mono">DVIPDFM</span> <strong>utility</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Another easy method for producing acceptable <span class="text-mono">.pdf</span> files is via the utility
            <span class="text-mono">dvipdfm</span>. This utility is included in distributions of MikTEX, which runs
            on Windows machines, but it probably needs to be added to your teTEX
            distribution, if you are running <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span> on a UNIX machine. The utility and
            precise information about installing it on your system can be found at the
            web page <a href="http://gaspra.kettering.edu/dvipdfm/" class="text-mono">http://gaspra.kettering.edu/dvipdfm/</a>. In essence, this utility
            converts a <span class="text-mono">.dvi</span> file into a <span class="text-mono">.pdf</span> file. So, 
            one can first prepare the <span class="text-mono">.dvi</span> file using <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span>, 
            and then apply the utility dvipdfm to produce the needed <span class="text-mono">.pdf</span>
            file<sup><a href="#target-4">4</a></sup>. This utility makes inclusion of graphics particularly simple – those that
            are included in the <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span> source file are simply converted to the <span class="text-mono">.pdf</span> format.
            As we note below, things are not so simple with the second alternative, which
            is to use pdf<span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span>.
        </p>
        <p><strong>pdf<span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span></strong></p>
        <p>
            An alternative to the first possibilities to produce <span class="text-mono">.pdf</span> files is to process
            the source file with pdf<span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span>. This format is available from the standard
            CTAN sites <a href="http://www.ctan.org" class="text-mono">http://www.ctan.org</a>. It appears that
            <span>pdfLATEX</span> and <span class="text-mono">hyperref</span> have some problems when used together.
            It is necessary to use <span>pdfLATEX</span> version 14d or later in order to minimize these issues. If your system has
            an earlier version (most teTEX distributions have version 13d), then you can update your system by
            retrieving the latest version of pdf<span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span> from
            <a href="ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/cstug/thanh/pdftex/" class="text-mono">ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/cstug/thanh/pdftex/</a> . Even if the
            recent versions are used, pdfL A TEX has the same dealing with references em-
            bedded with the frontmatter section described above for <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            But there is one aspect of pdf<span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span> that creates problems. Many authors
            include EPS<sup><a href="#target-5">5</a></sup> files within their papers. While this is fairly straightforward
            with <span class="lates">LATEX</span>, there are a couple of points to note when attempting this with
            pdf<span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To include a PostScript image in a <span class="text-mono">.pdf</span> file produced with <span>pdfLATEX</span>,
            you first have to convert the image to a <span class="text-mono">.pdf</span> file, and then it can be in-
            cluded using the same command sequence as above. The conversion can be

                <sup>4</sup>
                <i>Beware</i>! The utility <span class="text-mono">dvipdf</span> does <i>not</i> produce acceptable <span class="text-mono">.pdf</span> files, and should not be
                used. Only <span class="text-mono">dvipdfm</span> should be used to produce <span class="text-mono">.pdf</span> files.

            accomplished most easily using Ghostscript; you can simply view the file in
            Ghostview and then print the image to a <span class="text-mono">.pdf</span> file using the <span class="text-mono">pdfwriter</span> option
            within Ghostview. The result for a standard chess board that is part of the
            Ghostview distribution is the following image:

                Here as well is a copy of a color image. While <span>pdfLATEX</span> can handle image files
                in other formats, L A TEX can only handle <span class="text-mono">.eps</span> images reliably.

                It also should be noted that we have included two separate source files for
                this example file – one for <span class="text-latex">l<span>a</span>t<span>e</span>x</span> and one for

            <strong>Using ENTCS Macros with Mac OS X</strong><br/>
            Of course, if your file doesn’t require .eps or other PostScript files, then
            you can create the required .pdf file using any of the standard TEX imple-
            mentations for the Macintosh. If you need to include PostScript files, and if
            you are using TEXShop, then you can specify to use dvips and ghostview in
            processing your file, and then you can apply ps2pdf to create the needed .pdf
            file. Alternatibely, the Mac OS X operating system is based on UNIX, so it
            supports the use of teTEX as described above.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            The ENTCS macro package is relatively easy to use and provides a uniform
            layout for all the papers that appear in ENTCS.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Problem 5.1</strong> <i>Finish your paper and get it to your Program Chairman on
            time!</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            When you have finished preparing your paper, send a copy of the source file,
            together with any macro files that are needed to your Program Chairman. If
            the files are extensive, you can place copies in the pub/incoming sub-directory
            of the ftp directory on the machine indicated by your Program Chairman using
            anonymous ftp. If you do this, please send me email to alert me that the file(s)
            are here.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Assigning Volume / Issue Numbers</strong><br/>
            One additional point worth mentioning is that ENTCS is moving to Sci-
            enceDirect, Elsevier’s main platform for publishing electronic series, Because
            ScienceDirect must publish entire volumes at the same time, we have changed
            the procedure for preparing final versions so that volume numbers will not
            be assigned until the final versions are ready. Guest Editors will now have
            to receive the final version of all papers in their <i>Proceedings</i> before a volume
            and issue number will be assigned for the <i>Proceedings</i>. Even with the move to
            ScienceDirect, the reference scheme already used for publications in ENTCS –
            <span class="text-mono">http://www.elsevier/nl/locate/entcs/NNnn.html</span> remains the valid way
            to cite papers published in ENTCS, where NN denotes the number of the vol-
            ume, and nn denotes the issue number. Publications consisting of an entire
            volume should use 1 as the issue number.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Copyright Transfer Forms</strong><br/>
            One result of the move to ScienceDirect is that the corresponding author
            of each paper published in ENTCS must submit a signed Copyright Transfer
            8Please list Your Lastname Here
            Form to Elsevier in order for their paper to be published. A copy of this form
            will be sent to each author by the Guest Editors of each volume. Details about
            this agreement specifying the rights of the authors and the rights of Elsevier
            are available at <a href="http://authors.elsevier.com/PublisherInfoDetail.html?dc=AGI">Elsevier’s Author Gateway</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Publication of Final Versions</strong><br/>
            Because ScienceDirect cannot easily accommodate changes to published
            material, the Proceedings in its entirety must be ready before it can be pub-
            lished. This is one reason why the volume and issue number is not assigned
            until the final versions of all papers have been sent to the Guest Editors for
            final processing.

        <h3>Bibliographical references</h3>
        <p>
            ENTCS employs the plain style of bibliographic references in which references
            are listed in alphabetical order, according the the first author’s last name, and
            are sequentially numbered. Please utilize this style. We have a BibTEX style
            file, for those who wish to use it. It is the file <span class="text-mono">entcs.bst</span> which is included in
            this package. The basic rules we have employed are the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Authors’ names should be listed in alphabetical order, with the first author’s
                last name being the first listing, followed by the author’s initials or first
                name, and with the other authors names listed as <i>first name, last name</i>.
            </li>
            <li>Titles of articles in journals should be in <i>emphasized</i> type.</li>
            <li>Titles of books, monographs, etc. should be in quotations.</li>
            <li>Journal names should be in plain roman type.</li>
            <li>
                Journal volume numbers should be in boldface type, with the year of pub-
                lication immediately following in roman type, and enclosed in parentheses.
            </li>
            <li>
                References to URLs on the net should be “active” and the URL itself should
                be in typewriter font.
            </li>
            <li>Articles should include page numbers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The criteria are illustrated in the following.
