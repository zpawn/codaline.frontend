            <h3>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                This short note provides a guide to using the ENTCS macro package for
                preparing papers for publication in your conference <i>Proceedings</i>. The <i>Pro-
                ceedings</i> may be printed and hard copies distributed to participants at the
                meeting; this is an option to Conference Organizers may choose to exercise.
                The <i>Proceedings</i> also will be par of a volume in the series <i>Electronic Notes
                in Theoretical Computer Science</i> (ENTCS), which is published under the aus-
                pices of Elsevier Science B. V., the publishers of <i>Theoretical Computer Science</i>.
                It’s home page is <span style="font-family: monospace;">http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                The ENTCS macro package consists of two files:
                entcs.cls, the basic style file, and
            </p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-family: monospace">entcsmacro.sty</span>, a macro file containing the definitions of some of the theorem-like environments and a few other tidbits.
            </p>
            <p>
                The formatting these style files impose should <i>not</i> be altered – the reason for
            using them is to attain a uniform format for all papers in the <i>Proceedings</i> of
            which your paper is a part.
            </p>
            <p>
                    Additional macro files can be added using <span style="font-family: monospace">\usepackage{...}</span>. The file
                <span style="font-family: monospace">entcsmacro.sty</span> <i>must</i> be included in the list, as is done at the start of the
                source file for this paper.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ENTCS package requires a relatively up-to-date L<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X system in order
                to be successfully used. This is reflected in two other packages that are called
                by entcs.cls, which must be available on your machine. These are:
            </p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 20px">
                <li>
                    The hyperref package. This package allows the use of hyperlinks in files
                    prepared using L<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X2e, one of the main features of Adobe’s Acrobat<sup>&copy;</sup>
                    Reader software. Be sure that you have at least version 6.69d of this pack-
                    age.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The ifpdf package. This is used by hyperref to differentiate between the
                    use of pdfL<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X and <span>LATEX2e</span>, followed by dvips and then ps2pdf.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The file <span style="font-family: monospace">instraut.dvi</span> contains information about the use of L<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>Xto pre-
                pare files for online publication by Elsevier. This file refers to the older version
                of L<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X that is no longer suppported, and that is inadequate for preparing
                <span style="font-family: monospace">.pdf</span> files for online publication. Reading this file should answer most of the
                basic questions about L<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X that might arise.
            </p>

            <h3>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frontmatter</h3>
            <p>
                The biggest difference between a “usual” L<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X style such as <span style="font-family: monospace">article.sty</span>
                and the ENTCS package is that the ENTCS macro package requires the title,
                author’s name or names, abstract, keywords and “thanks” all to be included
                within the <span style="font-family: monospace">frontmatter</span> environment. At the beginning of the source file for
                this paper, you’ll notice this. Also, you’ll notice that the usual <span style="font-family: monospace">\maketitle</span>
                is absent; it no longer is needed. The ENTCS style package automatically
                generates the title, author’s name and address, and related material at the
                beginning of the paper. Note also that hyperref has been disabled in this part
                of the entcs.cls file, so references to footnotes aren’t linked to the appropriate
                footenotes or addresses. This is an old problem with L<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X, involving the fact
                that the references within the frontmatter aren’t passed cleanly to the linking
                software.
            </p>
            <p>
                For those who have used the ENTCS package before, the one new thing
                to note is the inclusion of <i>Keywords</i>; these are now required by Elsevier –
                they’re also required by ACM’s <i>Computing Reviews</i> which reviews ENTCS
                publications.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ENTCS macro package provides two alternatives to listing authors
                names and addresses. These are described in detail in the file <span style="font-family: monospace">instraut.dvi</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Basically, listing each author and his or her address in turn, is the simplest
                method. But, if there are several authors and two or more share the same
                address (but not all authors are at this address), then the method of listing
                authors first, and then the addresses, and of referencing addresses to authors
                should be used.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, notice that acknowledgment of support (the contents of <span style="font-family: monospace">\thanks</span>)
                should be done by a separate listing of <span style="font-family: monospace">\thanks[NSF]{To the NSF}</span> with the
                optional argument – <span style="font-family: monospace">[NSF]</span> – being used for <span style="font-family: monospace">\thanksref</span> which is attached to
                those authors acknowledging such support. It is important that the <span style="font-family: monospace">\thanks</span>
                not be included within the scope of <span style="font-family: monospace">\author{}</span> or of <span style="font-family: monospace">\title{}</span>, but it must
                be within the scope of the environment <span style="font-family: monospace">frontmatter</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                More details about added terms such as <span style="font-family: monospace">\collab</span> can be found in inst.dvi,
                if they are needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, notice that the command <span style="font-family: monospace">\lastname{My Lastname}</span> has been in-
                cluded <i>before</i> the <span style="font-family: monospace">frontmatter</span> begins. This command should contain the
                last names of the authors of the paper. If there are no more than three au-
                thors, then they should be listed with the word “and” between the last two;
                if more than three authors collaborated on the paper, then the first author
                only should be listed, together with <span style="font-family: monospace">\emph{et al}</span>. This command creates
                the headline for each page after page 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, please be sure to include an abstract for your paper.
            </p>

            <h3>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sectioning and Environments</h3>
            <p>
                Since ENTCS is published through the auspices of Elsevier Science B. V., their
                style files have been used to create the ENTCS macro package. Here’s a proof
                that this package is not much different than most of the ones one encounters:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Definition 3.1</strong> A file is <i>derived</i> from another if it is obtained with only a few
                modifications from the original file.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Theorem 3.2</strong> <i>The file</i> <span style="font-family: monospace">entcs.cls</span> <i>is derived</i> <span style="font-family: monospace">from elsart.sty</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Proof.</strong> This is clear from the similarity of the output to the output from
                Elsevier’s style files.
            </p>
            <p>
                If one wants to start a proof with a descriptive word, such as “sketch”,
                then one can use the <span style="font-family: monospace">\begin{proof*}...\end{proof*}</span> environment, as in
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Proof (Sketch)</strong> This can be derived from simple observations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main differences between the file <span style="font-family: monospace">entcs.cls</span> and the <span style="font-family: monospace">elsartr.cls</span> file
                used by Elsevier are the more precise format we use – Elsevier’s generic files are
                meant for preliminary editing, and more precise formatting is imposed using
                a macro file designed for the specific Elsevier journal in which the paper will
                eventually appear. The <span style="font-family: monospace">entcs.cls</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace">entcsmacro.sty</span> files format papers
                3Please list Your Lastname Here
                uniformly so that they all are easily recognizable as being from the series
                <i>Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                All of the usual features of L<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X are available with these style files –
                it is only the formatting that has been rigorously defined. Thus, one has
                available the sectioning commands <span style="font-family: monospace">\section</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace">\subsection</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace">\paragraph</span> and
                <span style="font-family: monospace">\subparagraph</span>. The numbering scheme used is one under which Theorem
                1.2.3 is the third numbered item in second subsection of the first section of
                the paper. In order to facilitate cross-references, all of the named environments
                given below are numbered, and all use the same number scheme.
            </p>
            <p>
                The file entcsmacro.sty contains additional information that is needed to
                typeset a paper. It also has the definitions of the AMS euler and blackboard
                bold fonts builtin. If you want to use symbols for the natural numbers, the
                reals, etc., then we prefer that you use the blackboard bold fonts, and not
                plain bold fonts. This is accomplished by using the <span style="font-family: monospace">\mathbb</span> font, as in N or
                R.
            </p>
            <p>
                The names of theorem-like environments are provided in <span style="font-family: monospace">entcsmacro.sty</span>.
                With the exception of the environment Algorithm, the names of all of these
                are full name, rather than a shortened version. The environments provided
                and their names are

            <h3>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;References and Cross-references</h3>
            <p>
                All the cross-referencing facilities of L<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X are supported, so one can use
                <span style="font-family: monospace">\ref{}</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace">\cite{}</span> for cross-references within the paper and for references
                to bibliographic items. As is done in this note, the <strong>References</strong> section <a href="#link6">6</a> can
                be composed with <span style="font-family: monospace">\begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}</span>.
                Alternatively, BibTEX can be used to compile the bibliography. Whichever
                one is used, the references are to be numbered consecutively, rather than by
                author-defined acronyms. Of course you can use your own acronyms for easy
                reference to each of the items in the bibliography, as has been done with the
                listing for this short note.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, note that the references should <i>not</i> be started with a new <span style="font-family: monospace">\section</span>
                command.
            </p>
            <p>
                The package hyperref is automatically loaded by entcs.cls, and this makes
                all the cross-references within the document “active” when the pdf file of the
                paper is viewed with Adobe’s Acrobat<sup>&copy;</sup> Reader. The format for including
                a link is simple: simply insert <span style="font-family: monospace">\href{URL} {text}</span> where <i>URL</i> is the URL
                to which you want the link to point, and <i>text</i> is the text you want to be
                highlighted, which when clicked upon will bring up the desired web page.
            </p>

            <i>4.1 Particulars about</i> <span style="font-family: monospace">.pdf</span> files
            <p>
                We now require that <span style="font-family: monospace">.pdf</span> files be provided for publication online. A <span style="font-family: monospace">.pdf</span>
                file is viewable by Adobe’s Acrobat<sup>&copy;</sup> viewer, which can be configured to load
                automatically within a browser. Viewing a properly formatted .pdf file with
                Acrobat c allows the cross-references and links to URLs to be active. In fact,
                Elsevier utilizes .pdf files in order to take better advantage of the web’s ca-
                pabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                But one point we want to emphasize is that you should be sure to use Type
                1 fonts when you typeset your L<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X source file. These fonts are scalable,
                meaning that they carry information that allows the devise viewing the final
                output to scale the fonts to suit the viewer being used – from an onscreen
                viewer such as Adobe’s Acrobat c Reader, to printing the file on a printer.
                You can tell if you have used the right fonts by viewing the final output on
                your machine. It the fonts look grainy, then you have not used Type 1 fonts.
                They can be located at the CTAN archive <a href="http://www.ctan.org" style="font-family: monospace">http://www.ctan.org</a> – they are
                public domain fonts, and don’t cost anything to add them to your system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Assuming you have Type 1 fonts available, then there are there methods
                for producing <span style="font-family: monospace">.pdf</span> files.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Using</strong> <span style="font-family: monospace">dvips</span> <strong>and</strong> <span style="font-family: monospace">ps2pdf</span></p>
            <p>
                We list this option first since it appears to be the most reliable and the
                easiest to use, especially if you include embedded PostScript graphics (<span style="font-family: monospace">.eps</span>
                files) in your source file. Simply run L<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X2e on your source file, then apply
                dvips to produce a PostScript file, and finally apply ps2pdf to obtain a <span style="font-family: monospace">.pdf</span>
                file.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The</strong> <span style="font-family: monospace">DVIPDFM</span> <strong>utility</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Another easy method for producing acceptable <span style="font-family: monospace">.pdf</span> files is via the utility
                <span style="font-family: monospace">dvipdfm</span>. This utility is included in distributions of MikTEX, which runs
                on Windows machines, but it probably needs to be added to your teTEX
                distribution, if you are running L<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X on a UNIX machine. The utility and
                precise information about installing it on your system can be found at the
                web page <a href="http://gaspra.kettering.edu/dvipdfm/" style="font-family: monospace">http://gaspra.kettering.edu/dvipdfm/</a>. In essence, this utility
                converts a <span style="font-family: monospace">.dvi</span> file into a <span style="font-family: monospace">.pdf</span> file. So, one can first prepare the <span style="font-family: monospace">.dvi</span> file
                using L<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X, and then apply the utility dvipdfm to produce the needed <span style="font-family: monospace">.pdf</span>
                file<sup><a href="#target-4">4</a></sup>. This utility makes inclusion of graphics particularly simple – those that
                are included in the L<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X source file are simply converted to the <span style="font-family: monospace">.pdf</span> format.
                As we note below, things are not so simple with the second alternative, which
                is to use pdfL<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X.
            </p>
            <p><strong>pdfL<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X</strong></p>
            <p>
                An alternative to the first possibilities to produce <span style="font-family: monospace">.pdf</span> files is to process
                the source file with pdfL<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X. This format is available from the standard
                CTAN sites <a href="http://www.ctan.org" style="font-family: monospace;">http://www.ctan.org</a>. It appears that <span>pdfLATEX</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace">hyperref</span>
                have some problems when used together. It is necessary to use <span>pdfLATEX</span>
                version 14d or later in order to minimize these issues. If your system has
                an earlier version (most teTEX distributions have version 13d), then you
                can update your system by retrieving the latest version of <span>pdfLATEX</span> from
                <a href="ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/cstug/thanh/pdftex/" style="font-family: monospace">ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/cstug/thanh/pdftex/</a> . Even if the
                recent versions are used, pdfL A TEX has the same dealing with references em-
                bedded with the frontmatter section described above for L<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X.
            </p>
            <p>
                But there is one aspect of pdfL<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X that creates problems. Many authors
                include EPS<sup><a href="#target-5">5</a></sup> files within their papers. While this is fairly straightforward
                with <span class="lates">LATEX</span>, there are a couple of points to note when attempting this with
                pdfL<sup>A</sup>T<sub style="font-size: inherit">E</sub>X.
            </p>
            <p>
                To include a PostScript image in a <span style="font-family: monospace;">.pdf</span> file produced with <span>pdfLATEX</span>,
                you first have to convert the image to a <span style="font-family: monospace;">.pdf</span> file, and then it can be in-
                cluded using the same command sequence as above. The conversion can be

                within Ghostview. The result for a standard chess board that is part of the
                Ghostview distribution is the following image:

                <strong>Using ENTCS Macros with Mac OS X</strong><br/>
                Of course, if your file doesn’t require .eps or other PostScript files, then
                you can create the required .pdf file using any of the standard TEX imple-
                mentations for the Macintosh. If you need to include PostScript files, and if
                you are using TEXShop, then you can specify to use dvips and ghostview in
                processing your file, and then you can apply ps2pdf to create the needed .pdf
                file. Alternatibely, the Mac OS X operating system is based on UNIX, so it
                supports the use of teTEX as described above.

            <h3>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary</h3>
            <p>
                The ENTCS macro package is relatively easy to use and provides a uniform
                layout for all the papers that appear in ENTCS.

                <strong>Problem 5.1</strong> <i>Finish your paper and get it to your Program Chairman on
                time!</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                When you have finished preparing your paper, send a copy of the source file,
                together with any macro files that are needed to your Program Chairman. If
                the files are extensive, you can place copies in the pub/incoming sub-directory
                of the ftp directory on the machine indicated by your Program Chairman using
                anonymous ftp. If you do this, please send me email to alert me that the file(s)
                are here.

            <p>
                <strong>Assigning Volume / Issue Numbers</strong><br/>
                One additional point worth mentioning is that ENTCS is moving to Sci-
                enceDirect, Elsevier’s main platform for publishing electronic series, Because
                ScienceDirect must publish entire volumes at the same time, we have changed
                the procedure for preparing final versions so that volume numbers will not
                be assigned until the final versions are ready. Guest Editors will now have
                to receive the final version of all papers in their <i>Proceedings</i> before a volume
                and issue number will be assigned for the <i>Proceedings</i>. Even with the move to
                ScienceDirect, the reference scheme already used for publications in ENTCS –
                <span style="font-family: monospace;">http://www.elsevier/nl/locate/entcs/NNnn.html</span> remains the valid way
                to cite papers published in ENTCS, where NN denotes the number of the vol-
                ume, and nn denotes the issue number. Publications consisting of an entire
                volume should use 1 as the issue number.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Copyright Transfer Forms</strong><br/>
                One result of the move to ScienceDirect is that the corresponding author
                of each paper published in ENTCS must submit a signed Copyright Transfer
                8Please list Your Lastname Here
                Form to Elsevier in order for their paper to be published. A copy of this form
                will be sent to each author by the Guest Editors of each volume. Details about
                this agreement specifying the rights of the authors and the rights of Elsevier
                are available at <a href="http://authors.elsevier.com/PublisherInfoDetail.html?dc=AGI">Elsevier’s Author Gateway</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Publication of Final Versions</strong><br/>
                Because ScienceDirect cannot easily accommodate changes to published
                material, the Proceedings in its entirety must be ready before it can be pub-
                lished. This is one reason why the volume and issue number is not assigned
                until the final versions of all papers have been sent to the Guest Editors for
                final processing.
            </p>
            <h3>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bibliographical references</h3>
            <p>
                ENTCS employs the plain style of bibliographic references in which references
                are listed in alphabetical order, according the the first author’s last name, and
                are sequentially numbered. Please utilize this style. We have a BibTEX style
                file, for those who wish to use it. It is the file <span style="font-family: monospace;">entcs.bst</span> which is included in
                this package. The basic rules we have employed are the following:
            </p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 15px">
                <li>
                    Authors’ names should be listed in alphabetical order, with the first author’s
                    last name being the first listing, followed by the author’s initials or first
                    name, and with the other authors names listed as <i>first name, last name</i>.
                </li>
                <li>Titles of articles in journals should be in <i>emphasized</i> type.</li>
                <li>Titles of books, monographs, etc. should be in quotations.</li>
                <li>Journal names should be in plain roman type.</li>
                <li>
                    Journal volume numbers should be in boldface type, with the year of pub-
                    lication immediately following in roman type, and enclosed in parentheses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    References to URLs on the net should be “active” and the URL itself should
                    be in typewriter font.
                </li>
                <li>Articles should include page numbers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The criteria are illustrated in the following.
